# Welcome!
Hello! This is my first Arduino Personal Project for Personal Benefits #1 (APP_PB_#1). This project is currently under slow progression status. Meaning I'm basically in a state of being busy wherein I don't have most of my time dedicated to this project. Even though it takes me about a year to do something about it.


# TLDR; What does this project do? / What so special about it?
It does report only sensor data and there's nothing special about it, seriously. But there will be an implementation where I have to use RFID to unlock my laptop and control its some functionality such as locking, unlocking (obviously), mode setting and other such. I just want to create a simple prototype that can be hardened by the use of connecting it to the web. By the means of reporting data from the internet. This way I could get concept of returning data from app to hardware or vice-versa. I just want to get the main glipse of reporting and returning data from any platform by the use of this one as my base concept.

## Table of Contents

This README will be seperated in accordance with formality and content quality. Those two are: Non-Formal and Formal
Non-formal was done to answer peoples thought or my thoughts with the use informal words. Some sections in non-formal is basically not fitted to the formal section.


## Formal Introduction


## Requirements

Just in case what it feels to be a beginner and tries building something he doesn't know. Here are the requirements and materials needed to build this project.

### MATERIALS / Parts
```
```
### TOOLS For Software
```
```

### Skills
```
```

### Some Options
```
```

## Deployment

### For Arduino

### For NodeMCU


## CI Integration
### How does it work in your sketch?


## Contributing

There are no plans for contributions yet.

## Versioning

Currently, I use don't use any APIs regarding software versioning. But instead, we usually do base on the date. For example:
```
When Build is done: at 4:51 PM at 08/21/2018
Result Versioning is: 108212018
```
But for sometime, I might use semantic software versioning system where I have to follow some guidelines instead the one that I have here. I may produce an issue of what kind of versioning system that I have to use in the future. Reference Issue is: #...
