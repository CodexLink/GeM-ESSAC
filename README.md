# Welcome!
Hello! This is an Arduino Personal Project for Personal Benefits #1 (APP_PB_#1). This project shows my current skills in C++ programming. And this also shows progression on how can I build a system with the use of electrical board circuits and computing Voltage, Current and Resistance per Each. Take this repository as a progression from Nothing-To-BitExperienced. 

## Table of Contents

> This README will be seperated in accordance with formality and content quality. Those two are: Non-Formal and Formal
Non-formal was done to answer peoples thought or my thoughts with the use informal words. Some sections in non-formal is basically not fitted to the formal section.

# Formal Content Section
## Introduction

## Requirements
Just in case what it feels to be a beginner and tries building something he doesn't know. Here are the requirements and materials needed to build this project.
```
MATERIALS / Parts

TOOLS

Optional 

[Important] Technical Required Skills

```

## Stages of Building
### Circuit
### Arduino Code
### PCB Design

## Deployment

## Travis CI Integration
### Introduction to Automatic Integration
### How does it work?
### How to do it?


## Contributing

There is no contribution outside for a moment. I'm planning to work on this part.

## Versioning

Currently, I use don't use any APIs regarding software versioning. But instead, we usually do base on the date. For example:
```
When Build is done: at 4:51 PM at 08/21/2018
Result Versioning is: 108212018
```
