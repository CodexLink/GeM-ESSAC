## Contributing

***There are no plans for contributions.*** No one knows how they would run this project without the device itself. However, contributions for **security flaws** or **codebase flaws** is possible. Just hit me up with **Issues** and once we got into agreements, I, myself, creates the PR or even you, who is responsible to create a PR with your own fixes. This was just an indication that an issue is being fixed instead of pushing commits and do normal issue reference along with PR on it.
